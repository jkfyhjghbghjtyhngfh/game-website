Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute!

- Report bugs or request upgrades using the `Bugs & Upgrades` page (`/bugs.html`) which opens a pre-filled GitHub issue.
- To add a new game: create a folder under `games/your-game-id/` with an `index.html` and assets (thumbnail, JS). Update `games.html` or run `scripts/generate_games.py` to scaffold placeholders.
- Ensure you have permission to host third-party games; include license info in the game folder or in `README.md`.
